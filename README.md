# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Performed various machine learning algorithms, data analysis and    visualization technique to detect fraudulent transactions from normal ones.
Outlier detection is a complex topic. The trade-off between reducing the number of transactions and thus volume of information available to my algorithms and having extreme outliers skew the results of your predictions is not easily solvable and highly depends on your data and goals.
For detecting outliers I have used two algorithms and identified which model is more accurate
